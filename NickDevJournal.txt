	I have made more progress to properly installing my Android Studio environment, once I finish doing so, I will be able
to begin writing code for mine and Mikhalev's 20% project. I, for the entirity of 6th period, was attempting to get a portable
version of Android Studio onto my flash drive, it continued to install throughout 7th period, and... didn't finish. Once I do
finish installing my environment, I will be working on some implementation of sound effects as well as the button layout for
the app. But for now, I will work on the logo and perfect that more, while slow computers install slow things.
